# Fasta_stuff

# This code was created by Augustus Snyder on October 19 2022 for the purpose of processing fasta files and extracting basic information, such as the number of gene sequences present in each file and the complete set of sequence IDs. 

# The code was tested and run in UAF's Chinook HPC cluster.

# A complete set of the files containing the bash script and example files can be found at git@github.com/CyclingNut27/Fasta_stuff or at amsnyder7@chinook.alaska.edu
